- 👋 Hi, I’m @LouisMichelin
- 👀 As of today, I’m interested in becoming a Front Web Developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript React while improving my CSS & HTML through OpenClassrooms.
- 💞️ I'm actually a beginner in JS, but I can tell that I'll be looking to collaborate on any project once graduated !
- 📫 How to reach me ; well, let's start through GitHub !
